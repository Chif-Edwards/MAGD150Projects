# MAGD150Projects
Lab 01: P5's basic geometry functions were used to draw two buildings in black and white.

Lab 02: This was the same as Lab 01, but this time color was used in composition and a space theme was used.

Lab 03: This project involved anchoring a series of circles to the location of the mouse and having different circles' locations change in different ways relative to the mouse.

Lab 04: This project is a pizza that you build by clicking the left mouse and deconstruct by pressing keys.

Lab 09: This is a fun little project where the sound of a rooster can be altered based on where the mouse is on the screen, along with loading in images from an external source and applying filters to them.
